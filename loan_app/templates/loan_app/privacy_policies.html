        </ul>

        <h2>4. Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
        <p>We process personal data for the following purposes, relying on the legal bases indicated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4.1 To provide and administer Services (Contractual necessity):</strong> processing is necessary to perform the Service you request, such as submitting applications to lenders, managing your application and communicating with lenders.</li>
            <li><strong>4.2 Credit and affordability assessments (Contractual necessity and/or Consent):</strong> necessary to assess your eligibility for credit and perform affordability and creditworthiness checks with credit reference agencies.</li>
            <li><strong>4.3 Identity verification, AML and fraud prevention (Legal obligation and/or Legitimate interests):</strong> to comply with anti-money laundering legislation, sanctions screening and to prevent fraud.</li>
            <li><strong>4.4 Marketing communications (Consent and/or Legitimate interests):</strong> where you have consented, we may send you marketing by email or SMS; in other cases we may rely on legitimate interests to send relevant non-electronic marketing with an opportunity to opt out. We will always respect your marketing preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>4.5 Customer service, complaints handling and dispute resolution (Contractual necessity and Legitimate interests):</strong> to respond to enquiries, manage complaints and improve our services.</li>
            <li><strong>4.6 Legal and regulatory compliance (Legal obligation):</strong> to comply with laws, regulatory requirements (including FCA obligations), tax authorities, law enforcement and court orders.</li>
            <li><strong>4.7 Analytics and website improvement (Legitimate interests):</strong> to analyse Website usage, improve functionality and security, and monitor performance.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Credit Checks and Automated Decision Making</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1 Credit reference agencies:</strong> When assessing an application we may share personal data with credit reference agencies (CRAs). CRAs will supply information such as credit scores and public records to lenders and will record searches on credit files which may be visible to other organisations and affect credit scores.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Automated decisions:</strong> Some aspects of credit assessment by lenders may involve automated decision-making and profiling. We will advise you where automated decision-making is used and provide information on your rights in relation to such processing. Where required by law, we will obtain your explicit consent before processing that results in a solely automated decision producing legal or similarly significant effect.</p>

        <h2>6. Sharing Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We will share personal data with third parties where necessary for the performance of Services or where required by law, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lenders and their agents (for application processing and credit decisions).</li>
            <li>Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.</li>
            <li>Payment processors and banks (for payment and disbursement).</li>
            <li>Professional advisers, auditors and service providers who assist us in delivering Services.</li>
            <li>Regulators, law enforcement agencies and tax authorities where legally required.</li>
            <li>Third parties involved in disputes, legal proceedings or collections where applicable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We require third parties to handle personal data securely and only for specified purposes. Where third parties process data on our behalf, they will do so under written contracts and appropriate safeguards.</p>

        <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may transfer personal data to countries outside the UK (including the EEA, or to service providers operating in jurisdictions such as the United States). Where transfers occur, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of UK/UK-approved Standard Contractual Clauses;</li>
            <li>Transfers to countries with adequacy decisions;</li>
            <li>Binding corporate rules or other lawful transfer mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will ensure onward transfer safeguards are documented and available on request.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including to meet legal, regulatory and accounting requirements. Typical retention periods may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application records: for the period required by FCA rules and for at least 6 years after the end of a business relationship.</li>
            <li>Transaction and payment records: for statutory accounting and tax purposes, usually 6 years.</li>
            <li>Marketing data: until consent is withdrawn or on an opt-out request.</li>
            <li>Complaint and regulatory records: for at least the period required by regulatory rules (commonly several years).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Specific retention periods will be determined based on the nature of the data and legal obligations. Please contact us for details of exact retention durations.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Legal Rights</h2>
        <p>Under UK data protection law you have the following rights in relation to personal data we hold about you (subject to applicable exemptions):</p>
        <ul>
